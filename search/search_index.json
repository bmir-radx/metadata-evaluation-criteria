Example : A metadata template with 10 fields, where 3 fields are empty, would have an overall completeness of 70% (7/10). Required Fields Completeness Description : The percentage of required fields that contain a non-empty value. Example : A metadata template with 10 fields, 4 of which are required. If all 4 required fields are filled, the required fields completeness is 100% (4/4). Recommended Fields Completeness Description : The percentage of recommended fields that contain a non-empty value. Example : A metadata template with 10 fields, 4 of which are recommended. If 3 recommended fields are filled, the recommended fields completeness is 75% (3/4). Optional Fields Completeness Description : The percentage of optional fields that contain a non-empty value. Example : A metadata template with 10 fields, 2 of which are optional. If 1 optional field is filled, the optional fields completeness is 50% (1/2). Consistency Associated Metadata Consistency Description : Metadata fields that are logically related should be internally consistent. Example : In the RADx Data Hub, the fields Estimated Cohort Size and Cohort Size Range should reflect the same cohort size. Similarly, Full Name should be consistent with Given Name and Family Name . Overlapped Metadata Consistency Description : Metadata fields containing overlapping information should be aligned in meaning and value. Example : In the RADx Data Hub, if the Acknowledgment Statement mentions a supporting NIH institution or center, it should align with the NIH Institute/Center field in the same study metadata instance. Cross-instance Metadata Consistency Description : Common fields shared between study-level and data file-level metadata should have consistent values. Example : If both the study-level and data file-level metadata include the Study Name , the value should be identical in both instances. Accuracy External Reference Accuracy Description : Validates that metadata fields referencing external systems (e.g., NIH RePORTER, funding sources) accurately reflect the information found in those authoritative sources. Example : Cross-checked against NIH RePORTER using provided NIH Grant or Contract Number(s) information to ensure alignment of NIH Institute/Center and Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number metadata. Linked Resource Accuracy Description : Ensures that URLs provided in metadata resolve to the correct and intended external resource, accurately representing the associated study or content. Example : Verified that ClinicalTrials.gov URLs point to the corresponding study. Validity File Format Validity Description : Validates that the uploaded file is a well-formed and syntactically correct JSON file. Example : A file that includes an unexpected trailing comma or unmatched brackets will fail this check. Schema Validity Description : Verifies that the JSON structure aligns with the defined CEDAR template. Example : A JSON file missing required fields like fileName or fileType will not conform to the schema. Value Constraint Validity Description : Ensures that metadata conforms to the constraints specified in the CEDAR template, such as allowed controlled terms, formats, data types, and required patterns. Example : A field like Subjects , constrained to controlled terms from an ontology (e.g., MeSH), must use valid concept labels such as COVID-19 . Free-text variations like covid-19 are not accepted, as they do not match the standardized ontology term. Accessibility Link Accessibility Description : Evaluates whether all link-type fields are accessible and resolve to valid, publicly reachable web pages. Example : Fields such as Study Website URL , ClinicalTrials.gov URL , Publication URLs , Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) URL , and RAPIDS Link are tested to ensure they are not broken and point to the intended resources. Uniqueness Metadata Instance Uniqueness Description : Ensures that each metadata instance is uniquely identifiable and not duplicated within the dataset or metadata repository. Example : Two instances with the same combination of Study ID , Data File Name , and Version would violate uniqueness. Each metadata instance should have a distinct identifier or a unique combination of key fields to prevent duplication. Linguistic Quality Text Formatting Consistency Description : Evaluates the consistency and cleanliness of text formatting. Example : The presence of unnecessary spaces, inconsistent use of line breaks, or other visual irregularities that affect readability. Grammatical Correctness Description : Ensures that text adheres to proper grammatical rules, improving clarity, professionalism, and readability. Example : A sentence like \"The study include data from 2020\" should be corrected to \"The study includes data from 2020\" . Spelling Accuracy Description : Detects and corrects spelling errors to maintain lexical precision and avoid ambiguity. Example : A value like \"diabtes\" should be corrected to \"diabetes\" . Punctuation Accuracy Description : Identifies missing or incorrect punctuation marks to ensure sentence completeness and proper structure. Example : A sentence like \"This study investigates heart disease\" may require a period: \"This study investigates heart disease.\"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#metadata-evaluation-criteria","text":"","title":"Metadata Evaluation Criteria"},{"location":"#completeness","text":"","title":"Completeness"},{"location":"#overall-completeness","text":"Description : The percentage of all fields that contain a non-empty value.
